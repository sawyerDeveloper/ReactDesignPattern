# React Design Pattern

This repository is an example of how to design the code for a React(Dom or Native) app where you don't need Redux for state management or external CSS files for styling.  In my professional experience these are the 2 biggest causes of problems in modern development.  

## Usage
Install [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) globally

```
npm i nodemon -g
```

Install server and client dependencies

```
npm install
cd client
npm install
```

To start the server and client at the same time (from the root of the project)

```
npm run dev
```
